Hello there !

Python and webdev enthusiast.

---

Interested in either very low or very high level languages;

Though much less with most in between. (not too fond of Java|C)

---

(F)OSS for life

Looking for a distro

Opinions are obviously my own, though I will gladly engage in any debate, and consider myself open to other opinions, on any subject.

I've also tinkered with other languages, like JS, Java, or even "pseudo-languages", like AHK.

Markdown is neat, so much so that I'm working on my own "flavour". (where's my __underline__ at??)

Latex is awful as a language, absolutely unreadable, and whatever you may say I will pronounce it Layteks. You could have set a `c` or a `k`, or even a `q`, yet you choose to put an `x`. WDYE?

Interested in linguistics as well. I believe they're called Conlangs or something ? Whatever – different vocabulary, same ideas.
