Hello there !

Programming, logic, math, and webdev enthusiast.
(notice how webdev is excluded from the three preceding topics)

---

Interested in either very low or very high level languages;

Though much less with most in between. (not too fond of Java ∨ JS)

---

(F)OSS is a mindset I fully support and agree with

Opinions are obviously my own, though I will gladly engage in any debate, and consider myself open to other opinions, on any subject.

— *Reconsider Everything* —

I've also tinkered with other languages, like JS, Java, or even "pseudo-languages", like AHK.

Markdown is neat, so much so that I'm working on my own "flavour". (where's my __underline__ at??)

Interested in linguistics as well. I believe what I'm doing is called a Conlang or something ? Whatever – different vocabulary, same ideas.

---

I dream of an OS...
